## Description ##
The original CEA2 (Chemical equilibrium for Applications) code from NASA is modified and wrapped with a thin python layer

## Scope ##
The basic idea is to allow chemical equilibrium calculations from within python including setting the thermodynamic state of a "gas" object.

## Road map ##
First step is to make it convenient to call CEA2 as a standalone program from python. At some point the CEA2 may be converted to a shared library. This may enable CEA2 to be called from virtually any program.

## FAQ:Will it work? ##
This project is for personal pleasure mainly, and it may fail in achieving the goal in any thinkable way. However, there is a slight chance that it actually may evolve into something usable.
